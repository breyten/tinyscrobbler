Tinyscrobbler is a lightweight LastFM track scrobbler library that allows to quickly incorporate the track scrobbling feature in a ruby player app.

I'm currently learning ruby, so it's very likely that some code is not written the ruby way.

Tinyscrobbler is not yet functional and under constant heavy changes.

More info soon...
